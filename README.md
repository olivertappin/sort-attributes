# Support

Currently, this package only supports _basic_ HTML in the form of simple, one
liners or the opening section of an HTML tag.

# Examples

Please see the following examples where this package will easily sort HTML
attributes in alphabetical order:

```<a href="#" class="anchor">Click me</a>```
```<input type="email" class="form__input" placeholder="Email address">```
```<nav id="nav" class="nav">```

Support for special characters, server side tags (such as PHP) and other inline
scripts are planned to be supported in future versions.
